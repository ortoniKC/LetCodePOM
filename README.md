# Page Object Model | Selenium | Java 🙅

Page Object Model, also known as POM is a design pattern in Protractor that creates an object repository for storing all web elements. It is useful in reducing code duplication and improves test case maintenance.

In Page Object Model, consider each web page of an application as a class file. Each class file will contain only corresponding web page elements. Using these elements, testers can perform operations on the website under test.
